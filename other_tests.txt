Other tests
===========

These tests are not so expressive to go on the README page, but they are
nonetheless useful to test pyper.

    This showed off the necessity for `reintegrate` iterator

    >>> from pyper import test, main, single
    >>> list_ = iter(['4', '5', '7'])
    >>> main(' list(pp) ', list_)
    ['4', '5', '7']
    >>> list_ = '''4
    ... 5
    ... 7
    ... '''
    >>> test(' list(pp) ', list_)
    ['4', '5', '7']

    Thanks to Chandrasekar Ravoori for the following test cases. This is a
    weird behavior, but I do not know how a user should use this kind of
    expressions and what he should expect from it:
    >>> input_ = '''2
    ... 6
    ... 3
    ... 4
    ... '''
    >>> test('p=="3" and list(pp) ', input_)
    False
    False
    ['3', '4']
    >>> test('p=="3" and list(pp) &', input_)
    3
